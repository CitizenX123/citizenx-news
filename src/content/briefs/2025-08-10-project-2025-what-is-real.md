whatHappened: Project 2025 is a political playbook, not a law. Parts of it only matter if they show up as signed rules, budgets, or laws with effective dates.
whatItMeans:
  - Headlines don’t change your life—effective dates do. If there’s no date and enforcement, it’s not real yet.
  - Watch agencies and the Federal Register. That’s where ideas become rules that hit your benefits, rights, or bills.
whatToDo: If a change could affect you, look for the official notice and date. Save links and screenshots. Ask your rep where they stand.

Short version: If it’s not signed, funded, and dated, it’s just talk.
