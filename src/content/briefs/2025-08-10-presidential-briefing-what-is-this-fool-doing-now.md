title: What Is This Fool Doing Now? — Presidential Briefing

topics: [President, Policy]

whatHappened: New announcements dropped, but only the items with signed orders, published rules, or funded line items actually move.
whatItMeans:
  - If it has an effective date (and enforcement), it can hit your benefits, bills, or rights. If not, it’s still just a microphone moment.
  - Watch the Federal Register and agency pages — that’s where talk turns into orders.
whatToDo: Before you stress, check the effective date and who’s covered. Save links/screenshots; share the real rule, not the headline.

Short version: Look past the press clip. If it’s signed, funded, and dated, it’s real. If not, it’s theater.
