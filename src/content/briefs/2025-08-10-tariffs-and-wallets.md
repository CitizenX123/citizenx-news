whatHappened: New tariffs got headline heat. Stores pay more on imports, then pass it to you. That’s the quiet tax.
whatItMeans:
  - If the tariff sticks, prices rarely drop back. It’s ratchet-up economics.
  - “Tough on China” often lands as “tough on your cart” unless paired with real price relief.
whatToDo: Track prices you buy monthly. If a fee or price jumps, save the receipt. Complain in writing; ten voices get action.

Short version: Tariffs sound like someone else pays. It’s usually you.
